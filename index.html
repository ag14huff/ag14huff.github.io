<h1>Abby Huffman</h1>
<h3>	I am a sophomore at Siena College.</h3>
<h3>	I am a communications and digital marketing major, and a multimedia minor.</h3>
<h2>Info:</h2>
<p>	I am from San Rafael, California. My Favorite sport is volleyball, but I enjoy watching basketball. My favorite team is the Golden State Warriors.</p>
<h2>Bio:</h2>
<p>	I really enjoyed growing up in California, and I look forward to moving back after I graduate from Siena. I am currently on the volleyball team here, and I enjoy spending time with my teammates. Back home I have one younger brother, Nathan, who is 16. My parents both grew up in the midwest, so we visit family back there a lot. Some of my hobbies include beach volleyball, ceramics, hiking, and cooking.</p>
<h2>Goals:</h2>
<p>	My dream job would be to work as a graphic designer or in marketing. This year I made the all-conference academic team, and my goal is to do so every year.</p>
<h2>Places:</h2>
<p>	I would love to visit Italy, Thailand, Hawaii, France, New Zealand, and Norway.</p>
